Industrial fault description:

F3 is a fault which occurs when the microservice is not properly configured.
If a micorservice is implemented by Java and using Docker as container, JVM and Docker configuration is needed.
However, JVM and Docker both have same configuration such as memory limit and cpu limit, while configuration in JVM and configuration in Docker influences each other.
If these configuration is not properly set, the microservice will have some unexpected behavior.



TrainTicket replicated fault description:

In the reproduction of F3, we mis-configured some microservice such that the JVM memory limit is bigger than the Docker memory limit.
In this case, if the requests occupy too much memory, the JVM process will be killed, leading to the microservices unavailable periodly.
Then the fault occurs.
