Industrial fault description:

F11 is a fault due to the lack of sequence control.
Note that such a fault may not always occur, making  it difficult to analyze.
Sometimes if a return value is too far from the normal value, the microsevice will recheck the correctness of the value and correct it.
But this process does not always happen, making the result sometimes wrong but sometimes right.



TrainTicket replicated fault description:

In TrainTicket system, there are two microservices set the same value in the database in order cancellation process.
Due to the lack of control like F1, the two microservices may set the value in a wrong sequence.
However, the second microservice that set the value may recheck the value and correct the value.
The recheck process does not always happen.
If two microservices set the value in a wrong sequence but the recheck process does not executed, this fault occurs.
