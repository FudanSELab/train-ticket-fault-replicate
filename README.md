### ts-error-F21

**industrial fault description**:

Symptom：
JAWS (a screen reader) misses reading some elements
Root Cause：
The “aria-labeled-by” element for accessibility cannot be located by the JAWS

**train_ticket replicated fault description**:

Just add the aria label in the login module.
There are three input types to read —  Email, Password and Verification Code.
When the cursor focuses on the input, the screen reader will read the value in it.
Add the "aria-labelledby" label to the "Email" and "Password" inputs to first read the input name,
so that user can make clear what the input value represent.
But the "Verification Code" input doesn't add an "aria-labelledby" label
So user will just heard the input's default value "abcd", it will confuse the user.

**fault replicate steps**:

setup system:

- Use docker-compose to setup the Train-Ticket System.
- Install and start a screen reader software

fault reproduce manually step:

1. Click [Flow one - Ticket Reserve]
2. Click [Tab] and focus the Email input, the screen reader will read the label and default value of this row
3. Continue click [Tab] until cursor focuses on the Verification Code row, 
since it misses a "aria-labelledby" label, the screen reader will not read the "Verification Code" string.
