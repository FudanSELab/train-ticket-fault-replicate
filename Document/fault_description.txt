This fault is caused by the error of redis in the operation of getting the saved key/token.
The microservice always save some key/token to redis.
However, sometimes the developer may made a mistake and the program may be mis-implemented.
In such case, the key/token may be wrongly read and deliver a missing/wrong key/token to other microservice, leading to an fault.



TrainTicket replicated fault description:

We have two types of users in TrainTicket system: normal user and VIP user.
Compared to the normal user, the VIP user has one more key/token to be used in ticket-booking process.
However, when vip user is processing ticket-reservation logic, the key/token is missing when delivering.
Then the fault occurs.
