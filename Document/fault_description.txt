F13 is one kind of fault due to the wrong processing order of multiple requests.
In a complex business process, we need send many requests in order to complete our business.
However, if we send these requests in a short period of time(eg. fast click), these reqeusts may not be processed in order due to the transmission delay or some other reason.
If the latter request needs the result of the previous request, such kind of fault like F13 will occur.

TrainTicket replicated fault description:

In TrainTicket system, if a user want to complete a ticket-booking process and a ticket-cancellation process, he/she will send many requests.
These reqeusts includes login, searching for tickets, selecting contacts, confirming tickets, payment and comfirming cancellation.
All these requests have a random delay to simulate the process delay.
If the comfirming cancellation is already begun but the payment process is still not completed yet, this fault will occur.
